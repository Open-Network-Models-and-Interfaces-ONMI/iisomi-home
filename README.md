# IISOMI
ONMI Informal Inter-SDO Open Model Initiative (IISOMI)

IISOMI is an open source project founded by UML model designers from various SDOs (Standards Development Organizations) like ETSI NFV, ITU-T, MEF, ONAP, former ONF and TM Forum. The goal is to develop guidelines and tools for a harmonized modeling infrastructure that is not specific to any SDO, technology or management protocol and can then be used by all SDOs.

Protocol neutral area:
* UML Modelling Guidelines
* UML Profiles and Style Sheets
* Papyrus Guidelines

Protocol specific area:
* UML to YANG Mapping
* YANG to UML Mapping
* YANG to OpenAPI Mapping<br> (transforming yang to OpenAPI RESTCONF specification)
* UML to ProtoBuf Mapping
* UML to JSON Mapping
* Planned - UML to OpenAPI Mapping<br> (Acceleo based tool to generate OpenAPI descriptions from an OpenModelProfile UML file)
* Re-engineered Models<br> (YANG specifications from IETF and IEEE converted to UML models)
